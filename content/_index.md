<h2>Technical Support</h2>

<p>I have been providing technical support to people who use Apple Macs since 1987. </p>

<p>I help people to understand the technology in their lives so that it becomes a useful tool rather than an intimidating burden. </p>

<p>Before offering any advice I ensure that I fully understand what my clients would like to achieve. </p>

<p>My services have ranged from setting up the network infrastructure, servers, workstations and telephone systems for an international publishing company with sixty employees, to replacing the hard drive in a ten year old Mac Pro for a freelance illustrator.</p>

<p>If you think there is something I could help you with please <a href="[[~18]]">get in touch</a>.</p>


<h2>Website Design</h2>

<p>I have been designing and building websites for the last eleven years. I do this with <a href="http://www.cathybrear.com">Cathy Brear</a>. Cathy is an illustrator and graphic designer who has worked for <strong>Dorling Kindersley</strong>, <strong>Quadrille</strong> and <strong>Tigerprint</strong> amongst others. The sight of website &lsquo;code&rsquo; makes Cathy feel sick. So Cathy tells me how to make the sites look beautiful and I go off to write the code in another room.</p>

<p>People can find setting up a website both exciting and daunting. I will guide you through the process so that you learn as much as you wish to about the technicalities of website ownership. I ensure that you are able to update your own website content if that is what you would like to do.</p>
<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

<p>Cathy and also I work together on print based projects. In an increasingly digital age we find this rather refreshing. Cathy does the design. I do the production.</p>

<h2>My Clients</h2>

<p>My current clients range from individuals like the author <a href="http://rspateman.com">RS Pateman</a> to international publishing companies like <strong>Ryland Peters and Small</strong> and academic institutions like the <strong>London School of Economics and Political Science</strong>.</p>

<p>I love to work with people who are passionate about what they do.</p>
