<h1>MODX Meetup</h1>

<p><strong>Thursday, July 6, 2017</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.adido-digital.co.uk/">Adido</a> hosted a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MODX-Meetup-London/events/239335656/">MODX Meetup</a> in Bournemouth on Thursday 6th July. 
</p>

<p>Mark Hamstra from <a href="https://www.modmore.com/">modmore</a> presented <a href="https://www.modmore.com/commerce/">Commerce</a>, his extra that provides a very powerful eCommerce solution for MODX sites.</p>

<p>Mark Willis from Adido talked about <a href="https://www.fuzzyseo.co.uk/">Fuzzy SEO</a>, a tool he has developed that allows you to quickly match your old URL sets to your new URL sets, automatically creating your website redirect list for you when migrating sites. I look forward to giving it a spin.</p> 

<p>Graeme Leighfield from <a href="https://www.gelstudios.co.uk/">GEL Studios Ltd</a> gave an inspiring talk, &lsquo;Bespoke. Buzzword, or Brilliance!&rsquo;, in which he discussed the value that we as web professionals provide to our clients.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to be one of the speakers. My talk covered some of the technical challenges I have faced with a website I have been building recently, focusing on some of the MODX Extras that have enabled me to build the site.

My slides for the talk are available for download as a pdf.<br />

<p>

<p>I would like to thank Helen Warner of <a href="http://www.crimsonpixel.co.uk/">Crimson Pixel</a>, Mark Willis and Mark Hamstra for organising this event. It was good to see some familiar faces and to meet some new MODX professionals. I hope it won&rsquo;t be too long until the next Meetup. 
</p>

<p>On Friday 7th July Adido will also host a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MODX-Meetup-London/events/241141324/">MODX bug hunt</a>.
